# Simple Markdown Editor
---
Simple and straight-forward markdown editor created using a simplistic front-end and [parsedown-extra](https://parsedown.org) in the back-end.

Created just for fun by [Quinn Zipse](https://quinnzipse.dev). Check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/quinnzipse)!
### Technologies {.mt-4}
---
- **Bootstrap** for fast and easy styling
- **jQuery** to make ajax requests
- **PHP** for the server side script
- **parsedown-extra** to parse the markdown content.

### Getting Started {.mt-4}
---
It's as easy as typing in the textbox to the left. When you're ready for it to parse the content, unfocus on the textbox and *poof*, perfect.

### What's New {.mt-4}
---

- **Printing!** Now, you'll only see the resulting HTML!
- **Dark Mode:** because let's be honest, no one wants to look at a white background these days
- **Meta Data,** to make the links look more appetizing.
- **Auto Dark/Light!** Checking to see if your browser is in dark or light mode.

### Coming *Soon* {.mt-4}
---

- **Remembering Data!** So when you switch between themes you don't loose your progress.
- **Cookie Banner!** This website uses cookies to remember what theme you prefer. So, we should probably include a cookie acceptance banner to comply with the [Cookie Law](https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/).
